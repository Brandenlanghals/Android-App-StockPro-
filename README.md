# StockPro+ Inventory Management App
The StockPro+ Inventory Management App is designed to address the needs of businesses and organizations that require efficient management of their inventory. It provides a user-friendly interface to track and manage stock levels, perform inventory updates, and generate insightful reports.

## User Needs
- The app aims to address the following user needs:

- Inventory Tracking: Users need a centralized platform to monitor their inventory levels, including stock quantities, item details, and location information.

- Inventory Updates: Users require the ability to update inventory levels in real-time, including adding new items, removing sold items, and adjusting quantities. 

## Screens and Features
To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, the following screens and features were implemented in the app:

- Dashboard: Provides an overview of the inventory status, including total stock count, and low-stock alerts.

- Inventory List: Displays a comprehensive list of all inventory items, showing details such as item name, quantity, price, and location.

- Add/Edit Item: Allows users to add new items to the inventory or modify existing item details, including name, and quantity.

## UI Design Approach
The UI designs of the app were created with a user-centric approach in mind. The following principles guided the design process:

- Simplicity: The interface was designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear labels and minimal clutter, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- Consistency: Consistent design elements, such as color schemes, typography, and layout, were used throughout the app to provide a cohesive and familiar interface.

- User Feedback: Interactive elements, such as buttons and form inputs, provided immediate feedback to users, ensuring they were aware of the actions they performed.

- Responsiveness: The app was designed to be responsive and compatible with various screen sizes, allowing users to access and use it on different devices.

## Coding Approach
The app was developed using a combination of industry-standard techniques and best practices. Some of the strategies used during the coding process include:

- Modular and Object-Oriented Design: The code was organized into reusable modules and classes, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- Separation of Concerns: The code was divided into logical components, separating the user interface, data management, and business logic, resulting in a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Code Testing
- To ensure functional code, thorough testing was conducted throughout the development process. The following testing techniques were employed:

- Unit Testing: Individual functions and methods were tested to verify their correctness and handle different input scenarios.

- Integration Testing: The integration between different components, such as the user interface, data management, and external APIs, was tested to ensure smooth interactions.

- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): The app was tested by end-users to validate its functionality, identify any usability issues, and gather feedback for further improvements.

## Importance of Testing
- Testing is a crucial process as it helps identify and fix bugs or issues in the code, ensuring that the app functions as intended. It provides confidence in the reliability and stability of the app, enhancing the overall user experience. 

## Innovation and Challenges

- The most challenging part of this project was implementing the SMS feature for alerting the user when an inventory item is low. I originally tried to create a checkbox during initial account creation that would initiate the SMS permissions prompt but could not get it to function as intended. Taking a loss, I removed the checkbox and moved the SMS permissions to prompt the user only during their first time logging into the app. As it stands, after a successful login, the user will receive the prompt. One area of innovation was implementing real-time inventory updates.

## Successful Component Demonstration

- The inventory tracking feature demonstrates knowledge, skills, and experience in designing a robust database structure, implementing data retrieval and manipulation, and presenting the information in a clear and concise manner to the user via a clean and intuitive UI.
